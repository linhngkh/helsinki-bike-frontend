## Install and Run the Project

## Front End
The frontend is made with React.js combined with Vite for faster dev-server and web development, managed by Yarn package. 

In term of mobile interface, this app also works well and responsive.

Main Dependencies: 
* [API Fetching](#https://tanstack.com/query/v3/)
Instead of using useEffect hook, React Query is my new favourable auto-managed queries.
* [React Router](#https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
Besides navigating seamlessly between each page, I also use useParams hook for accessing dynamically params from current Single Station URL. 
* [Material UI](#https://mui.com/material-ui/react-table/) 

Table component with useful functions:
  -  Ordering per column, 
  -  Paginating for huge rows of data
 
### [Home Page](#home-page)
Homepage was shown by introducing Helsinki City Bike headline animated by Framer Motion lib. It was displayed also the hero video which were cut from Helsinki City Bike's Youtube video.
